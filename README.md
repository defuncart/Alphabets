# Alphabets

*αბц* (Alphabets) is a simple alphabet learning application for iOS and Android. 

The app will initially focus on the Georgian alphabet, which plans to support Armenian, Greek and Russian alphabets.

## Releases

The app is currently in development: once the app enters alpha, an open testing phase will occur.

If you would like to build the app yourself, then you simply need:

- Xamarin Forms 3.3
- Xcode 10.1
- Android SDK 28

I personally use Visual Studio for Mac (version 7.7.2) but it should work on new versions and also on Visual Studio on Windows (without support for iOS building, of course).

## Branching

**master** contains the latest stable release.

**dev** contains the latest dev build. This may be unstable and may contain bugs.

**feature/XX** is a branch implementing a given feature. After a feature is merged into *dev*, the feature branch is deleted.
